# CSE 5914 - Capstone Design: Knowledge-Based Systems
## Automated-Twitter-Matchmaker

Welcome to the github repository for our capstone project at The Ohio State University!

For this course, we initially developed an automated Twitter "dating app" which would perform sentiment analysis on tweets to gather a user's opinions on various topics.

This would then be used to compare the user to other users, and find matches based on their opinions on said topics.

The code was then repurposed to begin creation of a "lie detector", checking a user's tweets over different time slices for their opinions on the topics to determine whether their opinions drastically differ recently from their historical stances on them, indicating that either they have changed their opinion or they are lying.
